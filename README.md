# DSforBusiness
The purpose of this repo is to provide simple and clean datasets for educational purposes - moslty focused on business - and also make clear the processes used to treat the datasets. You can find the source of the original files on the notebook.
This repository contains raw datasets - ended with .csv - and outputs datasets - ended with .xlsx. It also ccontains the notebook I used to clean the raw data - 'Cleaning datasets.ipynb'.
